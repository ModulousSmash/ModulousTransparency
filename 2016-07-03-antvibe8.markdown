Hello

I've stumbled on this site, which is quite a godsend for melee textures considering the listing on smashboards is coming soon to saturation, and I've seen some of my mods uploaded by someone else.

Those mods are the following :

http://modulous.net/mod/638/Team%20Rocket%20Falco

http://modulous.net/mod/508/Team%20Rocket%20Falcon

What I would like to be made is that instead of those mods appearing under this user, they would appear under my profile, since they're mine.

So, tell me what you can do so we can work out something.

Best Regards
